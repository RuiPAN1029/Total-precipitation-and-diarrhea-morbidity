1. The code only include the main steps for the main model and results (e.g., Figures 2, 3, 4);
2. The example data were simulate data. I show the main inforamtion of data in the R script for better understanding the code.
3. Please feel free contact the first author (ruipan@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp) if you have any question or comments about the code. Thank you very much!
